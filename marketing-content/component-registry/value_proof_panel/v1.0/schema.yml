description: "A credibility-focused section displaying evidence items with optional supportive media. Designed for showcasing awards, recognitions, certifications, and other trust signals."

when_to_use: |
  Use when you need to present credibility signals, awards, or recognition.
  Best for sections where external validation matters more than feature descriptions.
  Avoid using generic two_column layouts for credibility content - use this instead.
  The media is decorative and supportive, not explanatory.
