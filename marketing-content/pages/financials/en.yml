      - title: Payment Plans & Loans
        description: We partner with trusted providers to offer simple, accessible financing options tailored to your needs, including Ascent Funding with 3 to 5-year loan terms, interest rates based on your credit profile, the option to defer payments up to 9 months after graduation, possible inclusion of living expenses, and benefits like cosigner release and a 1% auto-pay discount; Climb Credit, which offers 3 to 5-year loans with fixed monthly payments that may start as low as $160+ depending on the loan and credit score, with no prepayment penalties; and TFC Tuition, which provides custom payment plans from 1 to 3 years and is a great option for students with limited or low credit thanks to a low entry barrier, easy approval, and competitive interest rates.
      - title: Scholarships
        description: Partial and full scholarships are available through mission-aligned organizations and location-based programs, with amounts covered varying by eligibility and availability, including merit-based opportunities, need-based financial assistance, special programs through 4Geeks Scholarships, and application support to help you through the process.
