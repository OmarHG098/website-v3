        comment: Thanks to 4Geeks Academy's bootcamp and their job guarantee program, I was able to change careers and enter the tech industry without a college degree. The mentorship and ongoing support were key, and after graduating they helped me find my first job in tech.

        comment: Before joining the academy, I always liked graphic design and photography. While working as a delivery driver, I realized how much I liked technology and the flexibility of these areas, whether remote or on schedule. I recommend and have recommended 4Geeks Academy.
