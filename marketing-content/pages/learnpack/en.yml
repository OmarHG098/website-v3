      ## Why LearnPack Matters in 2025

      In the LLM era, it’s pointless to memorize syntax. What matters is **thinking like a developer** and collaborating with AI. LearnPack turns any topic, technical or not, into an **interactive, auto-graded course** in minutes.

      Tell the platform a title, length, and learning goals, or add your own input (documents, videos, or just a topic), and it instantly produces a **structured syllabus** and a complete interactive course. It includes lessons, quizzes, and auto-graded exercises, no coding required. Then **Rigobot**, our 24/7 AI mentor, guides learners line by line.

      ### Some Context

      In today’s fast-evolving digital landscape, learning platforms must adapt to meet diverse needs. LearnPack, initially launched as a coding education tool, has evolved into a versatile platform that empowers anyone to create interactive, auto-graded courses without technical expertise.

      Accessible via [learnpack.co](https://www.learnpack.co/), LearnPack leverages artificial intelligence to generate comprehensive courses, making education creation accessible to all. This article explores LearnPack’s evolution, its AI-driven features, and its impact on global learning, supported by the AI mentor Rigobot.

      ## How Course Creation Works

      1. **Open LearnPack** at [learnpack.co](https://www.learnpack.co/) and start a new course.
      2. **Enter your course details**, including length, subject, and key topics.

      4. **Start learning immediately**, no coding setup, no Visual Studio Code required. Everything runs in your browser.
      5. **Have Rigobot by your side**. As you progress, Rigobot detects when you’re stuck and offers guidance without simply giving away the answer, like a teacher helping you reason it out.
