  - question: Why "Part-time?" and how does it work?
    answer: |
      We believe that the future of education is "part-time." Our approach is a blended education that leverages two proven formats: part-time training and flipped classroom. This methodology combines the following four pillars:
      Flipped Classroom: The theory is taught through videos, animation, images, and infographics. Class time is used to discuss, create and build projects, and to be mentored in solving practical exercises.
      Personalized Mentoring: Each student has the opportunity to have private conversations with a lead mentor on a regular basis.
      Mentor-Student Ratio 1:7 (on average): A close and personalized environment allows our academy to adapt to the particular pace of each student.
      Talent Tree: The curriculum charts 44 skills in which students earn points for each skill learned in a playful way.
