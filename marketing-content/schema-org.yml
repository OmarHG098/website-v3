# Schema.org Structured Data Configuration
# =========================================
# This file defines the base JSON-LD schemas used across the website.
# Pages can include these schemas and optionally override specific properties.
#
# USAGE IN PROGRAMS, LANDINGS, AND OTHER YAML FILES:
# ---------------------------------------------------
#
# 1. BASIC INCLUDE (inherits all properties from base schema):
#
#    schema:
#      include:
#        - "organization"
#        - "website"
#        - "courses:full-stack"
#
# 2. WITH OVERRIDES (customize specific properties):
#
#    schema:
#      include:
#        - "organization"
#        - "courses:full-stack"
#      overrides:
#        courses:full-stack:
#          name: "Full Stack Developer Bootcamp - Miami"
#          description: "Join our Miami campus for in-person training..."
#          location:
#            type: "Place"
#            name: "4Geeks Academy Miami"
#            address: "1395 Brickell Ave, Miami, FL 33131"
#
# 3. LANDING PAGE EXAMPLE (webinar/event with custom event schema):
#
#    schema:
#      include:
#        - "organization"
#      overrides:
#        organization:
#          name: "4Geeks Academy - Special Event"
#      custom:
#        - type: "Event"
#          name: "Free AI Coding Webinar"
#          start_date: "2024-03-15T18:00:00-05:00"
#          end_date: "2024-03-15T19:00:00-05:00"
#          event_attendance_mode: "OnlineEventAttendanceMode"
#          location:
#            type: "VirtualLocation"
#            url: "https://4geeks.com/webinar/ai-learning"
#
# 4. PROGRAM PAGE EXAMPLE (with course offers):
#
#    schema:
#      include:
#        - "organization"
#        - "website"
#        - "courses:full-stack"
#      overrides:
#        courses:full-stack:
#          offers:
#            type: "Offer"
#            price: "7999"
#            price_currency: "USD"
#            availability: "InStock"
#            valid_from: "2024-01-01"
#
# 5. ADDING NEW SCHEMAS (not in this file):
#
#    Use the "custom" array to add schemas that don't exist in schema-org.yml:
#
#    schema:
#      include:
#        - "organization"
#        - "courses:full-stack"
#      custom:
#        - type: "FAQPage"
#          main_entity:
#            - question: "How long is the bootcamp?"
#              answer: "The program is 16 weeks part-time."
#            - question: "Do you offer financing?"
#              answer: "Yes, we offer multiple payment plans."
#        - type: "BreadcrumbList"
#          items:
#            - name: "Home"
#              url: "https://4geeks.com"
#              position: 1
#            - name: "Programs"
#              url: "https://4geeks.com/programs"
#              position: 2
#            - name: "Full Stack"
#              position: 3
#
#    Each item in the "custom" array becomes a separate JSON-LD block.
#
# NESTED SCHEMA REFERENCES:
# -------------------------
# Use colon notation to reference nested schemas:
#   - "courses:full-stack" → courses.full-stack
#   - "courses:data-science" → courses.data-science
#   - "item_lists:career-programs" → item_lists.career-programs
#
# PROVIDER REFERENCES:
# --------------------
# Use "@organization" to reference the organization schema as provider:
#   provider: "@organization"
#
# LOCALIZATION:
# -------------
# Each schema can have locale-specific overrides under "locales":
#   locales:
#     es:
#       name: "Nombre en Español"
#       description: "Descripción en español..."
