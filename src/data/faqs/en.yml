      <span style="font-weight: 700;">Personalized Mentoring:</span> Each student has the opportunity to have private conversations with a lead mentor on a regular basis.<br><br>
      <span style="font-weight: 700;">Mentor-Student Ratio 1:7 (on average):</span> A close and personalized environment allows our academy to adapt to the particular pace of each student.<br><br>
      <span style="font-weight: 700;">Talent Tree:</span> The curriculum charts 44 skills in which students earn points for each skill learned in a playful way.<br><br>

    answer: |-
      Python is the fastest growing language in the wealthiest countries. It is widely used in virtually every industry and has top-quality libraries for all fields, growing to be "the future" in areas like Web, AI, Robotics, Big Data, and more. According to MIT Professors, it is the essential programming language to learn. Go ahead and take a look for yourself <a class="faq-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.python.org/">here</a>. Python is the way to go. It offers more job opportunities, helps you learn to code, and supports you with other back-end languages and frameworks. Even Google endorses Python and has incorporated it everywhere!

  - question: "Why not Node JS?"
    answer: |-
      Node.js is indeed an impressive technology, challenging the traditional approach to web development. However, only a small fraction, about 0.3%, of the web has adopted Node.js, and its growth rate has slowed in recent months. Meanwhile, languages like Python, Java, and PHP continue to dominate the industry and are unlikely to change anytime soon. These languages operate differently from Node.js, and our goal is to prepare you for the 'real world' by teaching the most standard and professional technologies. You can find a detailed argument explaining our decision not to teach Node.js in our Full-Stack Development Program <a class="faq-link" href="/us/trends-and-tech/dont-teach-nodejs-full-stack-development-program">here</a>.
