# Git and Validation

## Pre-commit Hooks

Optional FAQ freshness check via [scripts/pre-commit-faq-check.sh](scripts/pre-commit-faq-check.sh). Install as per comments in the script.

## Commit Messages

GitHub sync uses `[Author: X] Message`; consider similar clarity for human-authored commits (e.g. conventional commits or brief scope + summary).

## Validation

Run `scripts/validation` (CLI or service) when changing content or schemas. Fix validation errors before committing.
