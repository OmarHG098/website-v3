You are redesigning ONLY the “Why AI Engineering Now” section on the AI Engineering landing page (4geeks.com).
Current state is not acceptable
- Remove the current icon-based diagram.
- Remove the straight connector lines.
- Do NOT use icons in the new diagram.
- The new diagram must feel more original and premium, inspired by Supabase-style abstract diagrams.
Layout constraints (must respect)
- Keep two-column layout: metrics on the left, content on the right.
- The diagram must be compact and not oversized, so it does not compete with the metrics.
- Do NOT increase metric sizes. Keep them readable but not huge.
- The right content card should remain visually balanced with the left metrics.
New diagram direction (required)
Create an abstract, interactive network diagram (no icons, no labels inside nodes) that communicates:
AI Engineering is the connective layer between models, data, infrastructure, and applications.
Visual style
- Use only the existing blue palette from the page.
- Background stays light and clean.
- The diagram should be made of:
  - a central “core” shape (circle or rounded square) with subtle blue glow
  - multiple orbiting nodes as simple dots or small rounded pills (no icons)
  - soft curved paths or dotted trails (not solid straight lines)
  - faint grid or particle field behind it (very subtle), similar to Supabase vibe but adapted to light background
Interaction (main feature)
- On hover over a node:
  - that node scales up slightly
  - the path/trail connected to it becomes brighter
  - nearby particles animate subtly (or pulse)
  - a short caption text updates under the diagram describing that layer
- On hover over the central core:
  - the core gently pulses
  - all nodes softly brighten
  - caption becomes a summary sentence
Caption content (keep it short, not marketing)
- Provide 5 captions total:
  - default (core summary)
  - models
  - data
  - infrastructure
  - applications
- Captions should be 1 sentence, max 14 words each.
- No numbers, no claims, no metrics in captions.
Motion guidelines
- Add ambient motion in idle state:
  - slow drifting particles or slow orbit movement
  - subtle, elegant, not distracting
- No bouncing animations.
- No fast transitions.
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion: show static diagram, still allow hover highlight if possible.
Size and spacing
- Diagram height should fit nicely inside the right card without pushing content down too much.
- Keep generous whitespace around it.
- Ensure it looks centered and intentional inside the card.
What NOT to do
- Do NOT use icons.
- Do NOT use straight connector lines.
- Do NOT turn this into an infographic.
- Do NOT add new colors or gradients that introduce new hues.
Acceptance criteria
- The diagram feels original, interactive, and premium.
- It matches the page style (clean, blue palette, no icon set).
- It is compact and does not overpower metrics.
- Hover interactions feel smooth and satisfying, like Supabase.
- Section no longer looks generic.
Implement using SVG/Canvas/HTML/CSS/JS as needed, following existing project conventions.
