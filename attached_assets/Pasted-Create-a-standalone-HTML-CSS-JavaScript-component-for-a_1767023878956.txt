Create a standalone HTML + CSS + JavaScript component for an interactive "AI Engineering Workflow" diagram to be placed in the "Why AI Engineering Now" section of our landing page.
Design requirements:
- White background (#FFFFFF or very light)
- Use our brand blue palette: primary blue #007BFF (or similar vibrant blue), lighter blues #E3F2FD / #BBDEFB for accents, dark blue #0D47A1 for highlights
- Clean, minimalistic, modern look – similar to Apple or Vercel style
- Subtle shadows and rounded elements
- Responsive: works perfectly on desktop and mobile
Content & Layout:
- Central large circle or rounded card with "AI Engineering Workflow" text and optionally the 4Geeks/Rigobot logo
- Around the center, arrange 8–10 technology nodes in a loose circle or two columns (left: AI/ML tools, right: development/deployment tools)
- Technologies to include (use official SVG logos where possible):
  - Python (center or prominent)
  - OpenAI
  - Rigobot (our custom AI mentor – use a simple robot icon if no logo)
  - LangChain
  - Hugging Face
  - Git & GitHub
  - React
  - Node.js
  - Jupyter / Google Colab
  - VS Code / Cursor
Connections:
- Thin light blue lines (curved or straight) connecting the central element to each technology node
- Lines should be subtle (#BBDEFB or light gray)
Interactivity (lightweight, no heavy libraries):
- On hover over any technology node:
  - Node slightly scales up and gets a soft blue glow/shadow
  - Connecting line becomes brighter/thicker
  - A small tooltip appears with a short description like "Master prompt engineering & API integration" for OpenAI
- Keep it smooth and performant – use only CSS transitions where possible, minimal JS
Implementation:
- Use pure HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript (no external libraries except CDN for logos if needed)
- Use SVG for the diagram (inline or <svg> element) for crisp scaling
- Nodes should be rounded rectangles or circles with the logo + name below or beside
- Make it easy to customize colors and add/remove nodes later
Output the full HTML file that I can copy and embed directly into my landing page section. Make it visually attractive and professional – this will be a key visual element to show what technologies students will learn in our AI Engineering bootcamp.
