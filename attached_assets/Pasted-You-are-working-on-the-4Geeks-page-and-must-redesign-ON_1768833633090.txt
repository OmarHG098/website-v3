You are working on the 4Geeks page and must redesign ONLY the existing component/section titled:
“Human + AI: The Perfect Support Duo”
This is a VARIANT of the current component in the same place on the page. Do NOT change any other sections.
Design reference and intent
- Use the same overall layout concept as the Notion example provided:
  1) Title on the top-left
  2) Subtitle directly under the title (left side)
  3) A dedicated right-side area for imagery (top-right)
  4) A large information container at the bottom (in Notion it’s a 3-column box, here we will adapt it)
We are NOT building a pricing calculator. We are only borrowing the layout structure.
Visual system constraints (must match 4Geeks Full Stack page styling)
- Keep the same borders, subtle shadows, blue tones, typography, spacing, and radius used across the Full Stack page components.
- Monochromatic and consistent. No random new colors.
- Background stays clean and light, aligned with the rest of the page.
- Do not add new icon styles. Reuse only existing checkmark/list styling that already exists on the site (or convert to simple bullet points if needed).
Layout requirements (match Notion-like composition)
1) Top row: Split into two columns
   - Left column (60%):
     - H2 title: “Human + AI: The Perfect Support Duo”
     - Subtitle paragraph under it (1–2 lines max). Keep the existing meaning but tighten it for readability.
   - Right column (40%):
     - Reserve a visual area for imagery.
     - For now, place the current image of the woman with the laptop in the TOP-RIGHT area (where Notion has the crossed-out icons).
     - Do NOT add more new images yet. Just position this existing image cleanly and responsively.
     - Make sure the image does not overflow and stays aligned vertically with the title/subtitle block.
2) Bottom row: One large container (the “info box”)
   - Full width, aligned to the grid.
   - Inside, show TWO mentor types side-by-side (not stacked).
   - Use a 2-column layout (desktop) and stacked layout (mobile).
Bottom container structure
- Create two internal cards/columns within the bottom container:
Left column: “Expert Mentors (Humans)”
- Label (small uppercase): “OUR TEAM OF EXPERT MENTORS”
- Keep the 4 items (or tighten text slightly) as a simple list with checkmarks (no new icons).
- Ensure line length is readable, not too wide.
Right column: “Rigobot + LearnPack (AI Tutor)”
- Label (small uppercase): “RIGOBOT + LEARNPACK”
- Keep the 4 items (or tighten text slightly) as a simple list with checkmarks (no new icons).
Important positioning rule
- Currently these two boxes appear stacked on the left in the old component. Change them so they appear in a single bottom container with two columns, similar to the Notion “3 column info box” area.
Copy rules
- Keep meaning accurate and consistent with current claims. Do not invent metrics, promises, or quotes.
- Keep everything concise and scannable.
Interaction (optional but minimal)
- On hover (over the bottom container or the two columns), apply a very subtle border/shadow emphasis consistent with other components on the site.
- No heavy animations.
Responsive behavior
- Desktop: Top split layout (text left, image right). Bottom container 2 columns.
- Tablet: Keep split if possible, otherwise stack image under text but keep spacing consistent.
- Mobile: Stack everything vertically: title, subtitle, image, then the bottom container with the two sections stacked.
Acceptance checklist
- Section now visually matches the Notion layout concept: top-left text + top-right imagery + bottom info container.
- The laptop-woman image is placed in the top-right reserved area (temporary).
- The two mentor blocks are side-by-side inside a single bottom container (not stacked on the left).
- Styling matches Full Stack page: borders, radius, shadows, spacing, typography.
- No other sections on the page are modified.
