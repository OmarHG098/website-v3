You are redesigning the reviews section.
Objective
Upgrade the carousel that looks and behaves like the Supabase testimonials grid:
- Horizontal carousel
- Masonry / Pinterest layout with cards of different sizes
- Smooth, premium motion
But adapted to our white background and our existing design system.
Important references
1) Supabase testimonials section: masonry cards with different sizes + carousel feel + bottom shadow fade.
2) Our existing “Trusted by the World’s Leading…” component on GeekForce: use the same card surface style (light gray surface + subtle shadow + border radius). Do NOT invent a new card style.
Data source and reuse
- Reuse the existing GeekForce reviews component content (name, role, text, outcome tag).
- Extract the profile image from the existing reviews component and place it in the new cards.
- Profile image must be shown as a circle avatar at the top-left corner of each card.
Card style (must match our existing GeekForce cards)
- Use the same surface treatment we already implemented in “Trusted by the World’s Leading…”:
  - light gray muted surface (the same bg-muted/30 approach)
  - subtle border (very light)
  - soft shadow for depth (barely visible)
  - same border radius as the rest of GeekForce
- No dark cards.
- No new color variations.
- Keep typography consistent with the page.
Masonry layout requirements (Supabase-like)
- Cards must have different sizes and create an editorial mosaic:
  - some small cards
  - some medium cards
  - some large cards that include more text
- Avoid a uniform grid or same-height rows.
- Create repeating patterns similar to Supabase:
  - two smaller cards stacked next to one large card
  - occasionally swap sides for variation
- Keep consistent gutters between cards.
Carousel behavior
- The masonry grid must live inside a horizontally scrolling carousel track.
- Infinite loop: duplicate content so there is no visible reset.
- Slow constant auto-scroll.
- Pause on hover.
- Allow touch scroll on mobile.
- No arrows or dots unless absolutely necessary (if added, keep extremely minimal).
Avatar and header layout inside each card
Top row inside card:
- Circular avatar on the top-left (from existing review profile image).
- Name and role/job line to the right of avatar.
- Keep this area compact and aligned.
- Remove any non-monochrome avatar styles; photos are fine but should be lightly desaturated if needed to fit the aesthetic.
Review content
- Keep the review text unchanged.
- For smaller cards, clamp to a fixed number of lines (ex: 3 to 4) so the layout stays tidy.
- For larger cards, allow more text (ex: 6 to 8 lines).
- Do NOT edit or rewrite the review text.
Outcome tag / chip
- Keep the existing chip (ex: “Hired in X months”, “salary increase”).
- Place it near the bottom of the card consistently.
White background fade shadow (like Supabase, but inverted)
- Add a soft fade overlay on the bottom of the carousel area to create depth like Supabase.
- On Supabase it fades to black; here it must fade to white:
  - gradient from transparent to white
- The fade should partially cover the bottom of the cards slightly, subtle and premium.
- Optional: also add a very subtle top fade to soften edges.
Responsiveness
- Desktop: show the full masonry carousel with multiple columns.
- Tablet: fewer columns, still masonry.
- Mobile: single column or 2-column masonry with horizontal scroll, still not a simple strip.
Accessibility
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion:
  - stop auto-scroll
  - allow manual scroll only
Acceptance criteria
- The reviews section looks like Supabase in layout and motion, but uses our GeekForce card style.
- Cards are different sizes and form a masonry mosaic (Pinterest-like).
- Each card has a circular profile photo top-left, pulled from the original GeekForce reviews component.
- Bottom fade overlay is present and fades to white (not black).
- No redesign of other sections. Only this reviews section is modified.
