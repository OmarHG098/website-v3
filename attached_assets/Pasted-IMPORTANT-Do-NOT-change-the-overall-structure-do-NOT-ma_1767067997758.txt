IMPORTANT: Do NOT change the overall structure, do NOT make it a full circle, do NOT restart from scratch.
Start from the CURRENT diagram version (the one with gentle curved lines, horizontal-ish rows, rounded pill nodes, thin pale blue connectors, transparent interiors, subtle hover effects).

ONLY make these small adjustments to node positions for a soft oval/elliptical feel without breaking anything else:

1. Node repositioning (keep all other styles exactly as they are now):
   - Move the top row nodes (Python, VS Code, Jupyter, GitHub, OpenAI) slightly upward and outward in a gentle upward arc (make the middle three nodes a bit higher than the left/right ones, like a very subtle upside-down U curve).
   - Move the bottom row nodes (LangChain, Hugging Face, React, Node.js, Rigobot) slightly downward and outward in a gentle downward arc (middle three a bit lower).
   - Result: The 10 nodes should form a very wide, flattened oval/ellipse around the center hub — wider horizontally than tall, not a perfect circle, just a soft organic wrap.
   - Center hub stays exactly in the middle, no change to its size, shape, or fill.

2. Connector lines:
   - Adjust curves automatically to follow the new gentle arc positions (keep them smooth, wide bezier arcs, same thinness 1–1.5px, same pale blue color and opacity).
   - Do NOT make lines thicker, straighter, or more looped.

3. Everything else MUST stay identical to current:
   - Rounded pill/rectangle nodes (border-radius 16–20px)
   - Transparent interiors
   - Soft blue borders
   - Small blue icons + short labels below
   - Full width, compact height
   - Hover: scale + glow on nodes, lines brighten/thicken on connected node hover, center hover highlights all lines, solid tooltip
   - Staggered fade-in
   - No background fills except the very subtle center one if already present

Goal: Take the existing good diagram and just gently reposition the 10 nodes to create a soft, wide oval shape around the center — like a flattened ellipse, panoramic and organic, but still mostly horizontal in feel. Do NOT turn it into a perfect circle or radial mind-map.

Keep left stats and right text completely unchanged.
