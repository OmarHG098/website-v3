You are editing the “Real Results from Real Graduates” reviews section on the AI Engineering page (4geeks.com).
Goal
Redesign the reviews display into a premium “center focus” carousel:
- The center review card is always the largest and fully readable.
- The left and right cards appear behind it, smaller, partially visible, and slightly faded, creating depth.
- Cards rotate automatically with smooth transitions.
This should solve the visual imbalance caused by different review text lengths and make the section feel more dynamic.
Keep existing design
- Keep the current card styling (white background, subtle border, rounded corners, clean layout).
- Keep the star rating visuals.
- Do NOT change review content text.
- Replace non-monochrome avatars with monochrome initials badges or a gray silhouette icon (no colored faces).
Carousel behavior
- Display 3 cards at a time:
  - Center card: active, scale 1.0, highest z-index, fully visible.
  - Side cards: scale around 0.88 to 0.92, lower z-index, partially clipped, reduced opacity.
- The center card should overlap the side cards slightly so it feels layered.
- Auto-rotate every 4 to 6 seconds.
- Smooth transition when rotating:
  - use transform and opacity transitions
  - no abrupt jumps
  - no bouncing effects
- Pause auto-rotation on hover.
- Allow manual navigation:
  - swipe on mobile
  - optional subtle arrow buttons (only if needed, minimal style)
  - no dots pagination unless absolutely necessary
Layout and sizing
- Make the carousel container wider and taller than current layout so the center card has presence.
- Ensure the center card remains visually dominant.
- Side cards should be partially cut off by the container edges, like they are behind the center.
Text handling (important)
- Keep review text unchanged.
- For side cards, clamp visible text to a small consistent number of lines (for example 2 to 3) so they stay compact.
- The center card shows more text (but still keep a maximum height so the card does not become too tall).
- Keep footer chips (like “Hired in 4 months”) aligned and consistent.
Depth styling (subtle)
- Add a very soft shadow to the center card only to increase focus.
- Side cards should have lighter shadow or none.
- Keep everything clean and monochrome.
Accessibility
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion:
  - disable auto-rotation
  - show static center card with the two side cards, or show a simple horizontal scroll list
Acceptance criteria
- The center review is always the largest and clearly readable.
- Side reviews look smaller and behind, partially visible.
- Reviews rotate automatically with smooth transitions.
