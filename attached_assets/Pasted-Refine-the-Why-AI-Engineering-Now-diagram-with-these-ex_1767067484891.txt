Refine the "Why AI Engineering Now" diagram with these exact adjustments for a cleaner, more modern, and interactive feel:

1. Connector lines:
   - Make them noticeably thinner (1–1.5px max, elegant and subtle)
   - Use very pale blue (#A0D0FF or #C3DDFD), opacity 0.4–0.5 at rest
   - Change to gently curved lines (soft, wide bezier arcs – not straight, not heavily curved like a mind-map, just a very gentle natural curve for better flow)
   - No sharp angles, no thick lines

2. Center hub:
   - Add a very subtle, light background fill (#F8FAFC or #F0F8FF at 20–30% opacity) so lines no longer show through behind it awkwardly
   - Keep the fill extremely faint — almost invisible at first glance, just enough to define the hub clearly
   - Maintain pill/rounded rectangle shape (border-radius 16–20px), soft border, icon + "AI Engineering" label

3. Nodes (tech boxes):
   - Keep rounded rectangles/pill shapes, transparent interior, soft blue border (1–1.5px)
   - No changes to size, icons, or labels — they are good

4. Hover effects (full interactive upgrade):
   - Tooltip: Solid white (#FFFFFF) or very light blue (#F8FAFC) background, dark text, rounded corners (8px), subtle shadow — no transparency
   - On node hover (tech tools or center):
     - Node: Scale 1.08–1.1x + soft blue glow/box-shadow (0 6px 16px rgba(59,130,246,0.18))
     - Connected lines: Become brighter/deeper blue (#3B82F6 or #2563EB), slightly thicker (1.8–2px), opacity 0.9–1.0
     - When hovering center hub: ALL lines highlight (brighter + thicker)
   - Non-connected lines stay at rest state (or very slight fade to 0.3 opacity for focus — optional)

5. General:
   - Keep perfect horizontal rows (top 5, center, bottom 5), full width, even spacing, very compact height
   - Small monochromatic blue icons + short labels below
   - Staggered fade-in on load
   - Overall premium, clean, light, wide tech ecosystem — gentle curves, subtle hub fill, interactive lines, no heavy elements

Do NOT make lines thick again, do NOT use straight lines, do NOT leave center transparent, do NOT keep tooltip transparent. Focus on gentle curves and proper per-node line highlighting on hover.
Keep left stats and right text unchanged.
