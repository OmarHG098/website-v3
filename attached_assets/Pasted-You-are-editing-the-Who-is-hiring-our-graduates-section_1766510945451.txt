You are editing the “Who is hiring our graduates” section on the AI Engineering page (4geeks.com).
Important constraint
The company logos currently used in this section are image files. You must edit and normalize these logos as part of this task.
Logo processing requirements
- Convert ALL existing logo images to grayscale.
- Remove any brand colors.
- Do NOT keep original colored versions.
- Reduce contrast so logos are not pure black.
- Target a neutral gray tone similar to Supabase logos.
- Final opacity should be around 60 to 75 percent.
Logo sizing and consistency
- Normalize all logos to feel visually consistent, not equal pixel size.
- Logos should appear similar in visual weight, not height or width.
- Follow Supabase style:
  - Some logos wider, some more compact
  - All centered and balanced inside their cards
- Avoid logos touching card edges.
- Add internal padding so logos always “breathe”.
Preferred formats
- If possible, replace raster images with SVG versions.
- If SVG is not available, edit raster images via CSS filters or preprocessing.
- No logo should appear sharper, darker, or louder than the rest.
Section goal
Rebuild this section to match the Supabase “Trusted by innovative companies” carousel layout, adapted to a white background and strict monochromatic grayscale palette.
Carousel container
- Wrapper with overflow hidden.
- Soft top and bottom fade mask (white to transparent).
- Inner track that auto-scrolls horizontally in an infinite loop.
- Duplicate content to avoid visible loop jumps.
Pinterest style layout
- Cards must be different sizes (masonry / Pinterest feel).
- Avoid uniform grids.
- Cards flow as a visual wall, not rows.
Card design
- Transparent or near-transparent background.
- Very subtle 1px border in light gray.
- No shadows.
- Rounded corners consistent with site.
- Hover:
  - Very subtle background fill
  - Slightly stronger border
  - No scaling, no glow.
Motion
- Slow, constant horizontal auto-scroll.
- Pause on hover.
- Touch scroll enabled on mobile.
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion.
Acceptance criteria
- All logos appear grayscale and calm.
- No brand colors visible.
- Logos feel normalized like Supabase, not pasted images.
- Section feels premium, quiet, and SaaS-like.
- White background remains clean and uninterrupted.
