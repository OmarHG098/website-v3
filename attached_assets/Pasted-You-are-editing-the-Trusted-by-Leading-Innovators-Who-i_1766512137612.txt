Current status
The card styling and grayscale logos are correct and must remain unchanged (border, radius, monochrome look, logo sizing, spacing). Do NOT redesign the cards or logos.
Problem to fix
Right now the cards are laid out in a single horizontal line (logo strip look). We need the Supabase-style mosaic layout: a moving wall with a Pinterest/editorial rhythm, not a row.
Goal
Change ONLY the distribution and layout of the cards inside the carousel track to match Supabase:
- groups composed of: two small stacked cards + one larger card
- the larger card sometimes includes a short text line under the logo (optional) to create variety
- repeat these groups across the track so it feels like a masonry wall
Layout requirements
1) Replace the single-row layout with a 2-row (or multi-row) mosaic inside the carousel track.
2) Use a pattern like:
   - Column A: small card (top) + small card (bottom)
   - Column B: one tall/wide card spanning the height of both small cards
3) Repeat this “stack + hero” pattern across the track with small variations:
   - sometimes swap sides (hero on left, stacked on right)
   - sometimes use a medium card instead of tall
   - keep it visually balanced and organic
Implementation guidance
- Keep the carousel as a single horizontally scrolling track (infinite loop).
- Inside the track, build “mosaic groups” (each group is a mini layout block).
- Each mosaic group has a fixed overall height (ex: same as 2 small cards stacked), and cards inside adapt.
- Cards must stay aligned with consistent gaps (same spacing everywhere).
- Ensure no visible layout jumping as the track scrolls.
Responsiveness
- Desktop: show the full mosaic (stacked + hero cards).
- Tablet: reduce group complexity but keep 2-row feel.
- Mobile: collapse to 1 column or 2 columns with varied heights, still not a single strip.
Important constraints
- Do NOT change:
  - card border style
  - card background transparency
  - grayscale logo treatment
  - typography already set
- Only change the layout and distribution of cards in the carousel track.
Acceptance criteria
- The section no longer reads as a single row of logos.
- It looks like a Supabase-style moving wall: two small cards stacked next to a larger card, repeating.
- Cards keep the current clean monochrome style and logo treatment.
- Movement remains smooth, infinite, and premium.
