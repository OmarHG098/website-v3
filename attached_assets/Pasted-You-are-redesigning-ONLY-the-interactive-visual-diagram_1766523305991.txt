You are redesigning ONLY the interactive visual diagram inside the “Why AI Engineering Now” section on the AI Engineering landing page (4geeks.com).
This diagram must feel inspired by high-end SaaS system visuals (Supabase / Linear level), but it MUST NOT resemble a cube or any recognizable Supabase asset.
Goal
Visually communicate that AI Engineering is the structural core that holds modern AI systems together.
This is a system-level abstraction, not an illustration.
Remove current diagram
- Remove circular/orbit visuals.
- Remove icons.
- Remove explicit connector lines.
- Remove radial layouts.
- Remove node-to-node diagrams.
New diagram concept (mandatory)
Create an abstract “system core” composed of:
1) A central geometric core
- Shape should be abstract and non-literal.
- Examples (choose ONE):
  - layered hexagon outlines
  - stacked transparent planes
  - intersecting wireframe rectangles
  - offset geometric frames creating depth
- No solid fill.
- No recognizable object (no cube, no sphere).
2) Depth and structure
- Use multiple thin outlines layered with slight offsets.
- Use perspective and opacity to imply 3D structure.
- The core should feel architectural, like a framework.
3) Surrounding elements
- Add subtle floating points or particles around the core.
- These represent models, data, infrastructure, applications.
- No icons.
- No labels directly on the diagram.
- Particles should feel like signals, not decorations.
Center identity
- Inside or just below the core, add a very minimal text label:
  - “AI Engineering”
- Small, understated.
- Neutral color.
- No logo image.
Color constraints
- Use ONLY existing page blues and blue-grays.
- No new hues.
- No gradients that introduce green, purple, or neon.
- Lines should be thin and soft.
- Background stays light.
Animation behavior (critical)
Idle state:
- Extremely slow, continuous motion:
  - subtle parallax between layers
  - gentle drifting of particles
- Motion should feel alive but almost unnoticeable.
Hover interaction:
- Slight increase in contrast or opacity of the core layers.
- Particles nearest the cursor brighten subtly.
- No scaling jumps.
- No rotations faster than slow ambient movement.
Performance & accessibility
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion.
- Animation must stop or simplify when reduced motion is enabled.
Size & layout
- Diagram must remain compact.
- It must not overpower the metrics on the left.
- Maintain generous whitespace.
- Diagram lives comfortably inside the right content card.
What NOT to do
- Do NOT use a cube.
- Do NOT use icons.
- Do NOT use explicit lines connecting concepts.
- Do NOT explain concepts inside the diagram.
- Do NOT make it illustrative or playful.
Acceptance criteria
- Diagram feels technical, abstract, and premium.
- It clearly suggests “system architecture” without literal shapes.
- It feels original to 4Geeks.
- It visually elevates the section instead of distracting.
- It matches the overall minimal SaaS aesthetic of the page.
Implement using SVG or Canvas with clean, maintainable code.
