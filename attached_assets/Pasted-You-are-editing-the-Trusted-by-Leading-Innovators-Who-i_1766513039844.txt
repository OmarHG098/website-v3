Keep what is already correct
- Keep the grayscale logo treatment and sizing normalization already implemented.
- Keep the mosaic layout concept (stacked small cards + larger hero cards).
- Do NOT reintroduce brand colors.
- Do NOT add heavy effects or redesign the section from scratch.
Changes to implement
1) Make the entire card mosaic area larger (scale and presence)
- The mosaic currently feels too small compared to the Supabase reference.
- Increase the carousel area height and overall card sizes so it feels more “premium” and has more presence.
- Increase padding around the mosaic and increase the card dimensions proportionally.
- Keep spacing consistent (gaps should scale slightly too, but remain clean and not crowded).
2) Card background and subtle depth
- Set card background to bg-muted/30 (very light muted tint over white).
- Add a barely visible shadow to create depth similar to Supabase:
  - very soft
  - low opacity
  - no harsh edges
- Keep borders subtle. The card should read as a surface, not a bordered box.
3) Large cards: logo on top, text at bottom (Supabase rhythm)
- For the larger “hero” cards, structure the content like Supabase:
  - Place the logo near the top-left or top area of the card (not vertically centered).
  - Add intentional empty space in the middle.
  - Add a short text block near the bottom to balance the card height.
- The text is NOT a tooltip or label. It should be a short supporting sentence, subtle, light gray, and readable.
- This is required so we do not need to enlarge the logo to fill the card and we keep logo sizing consistent with smaller cards.
- Keep the text subtle and minimal, similar to Supabase customer story cards.
4) Remove hover name label for large logos
- Currently, on hover, large logos show the company name under the logo.
- Remove that behavior entirely.
- Hover should only affect the card surface subtly (slight background shift and/or border/shadow change), but no extra text appears on hover.
Additional requirements
- Maintain monochromatic palette (grays only).
- Keep infinite horizontal scroll and pause on hover.
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion.
- Ensure the mosaic does not collapse into a single strip on desktop.
Acceptance criteria
- The mosaic area has stronger presence and matches the scale feel of Supabase.
- Cards have bg-muted/30 and a very subtle shadow for depth.
- Large cards have logo aligned near the top and a short text block near the bottom.
- No hover label appears under logos.
- Overall look remains clean, premium, and consistent with the page’s white background design system.
Implement changes in the existing component/code, modifying only what is needed.
