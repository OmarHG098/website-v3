You are working on the GeekPal page. We need to redesign ONLY the existing component/section titled:
“Advance Faster, Never Lose Momentum”
This is a VARIANT of the current component (same section location). Do not change other sections of the page.
Goal
- Keep the same overall layout structure: a section title + a short subtitle + a 4-item grid.
- Remove ALL icons. We are no longer using icons in this section.
- Use a clean, consistent, monochromatic style that matches the Full Stack page components (same borders, same subtle shadow, same blue tones, same typography scale).
- The visual “accent” will be typographic highlight: in each card title, highlight only the first 1–2 words in the primary blue. No other colors.
Section styling (must match existing site system)
- Background stays the same as the current section (light / subtle blue-tinted background).
- Section width, paddings, and spacing must match the Full Stack page sections (do not invent new spacing rules).
- Use the same border radius, border color, and shadow style used across the Full Stack page cards.
Header
- Keep the same headline text: “Advance Faster, Never Lose Momentum”
- Keep a short supporting paragraph under it (1–2 lines) consistent with the site tone:
  “The #1 reason people quit when learning to code? Getting stuck. GeekPal keeps you moving with support that shows up exactly when you need it.”
Cards (4)
- Keep as 4 boxes in a grid (desktop: 4 columns if there is space, otherwise 2x2; mobile: stacked).
- Each box must be simple: no icon area, no image.
- Each box has:
  1) Title (one line) where the first 1–2 words are highlighted in primary blue, the rest in the standard heading color.
  2) Description (one short sentence, max 2 lines) in muted text.
Card titles + descriptions (use exactly these)
1) Title: “Always supported, never stuck”
   Description: “Get help the moment friction appears, before you lose momentum.”
2) Title: “Instant guidance, 24/7”
   Description: “The AI Tutor helps you unblock fast without breaking your learning flow.”
3) Title: “Real humans, when it matters”
   Description: “Mentors step in with context, feedback, and direction when you need it.”
4) Title: “Community support, built in”
   Description: “Peers and alumni help you move forward with examples and encouragement.”
Highlight rule (important)
- For each title, highlight ONLY:
  - “Always”
  - “Instant”
  - “Real humans”
  - “Community”
- Do not highlight anything else. No gradients. No multi-color accents.
Typography and spacing
- Match the same heading sizes used in the Full Stack page.
- Keep the cards readable: adequate padding, consistent vertical rhythm, no cramped lines.
- Do not add extra decorative elements (no numbered circles, no badges, no dividers).
Interaction (optional but subtle)
- On hover: slightly increase shadow or border contrast (very subtle), consistent with existing hover behavior elsewhere on the site.
- No animations that introduce new styles.
Acceptance checklist
- Section still reads as: Title + subtitle + 4-card grid.
- No icons anywhere in this section.
- Highlight is typographic only and monochromatic.
- Borders/shadows/typography match the Full Stack page system.
- No changes to any other component on the page.
