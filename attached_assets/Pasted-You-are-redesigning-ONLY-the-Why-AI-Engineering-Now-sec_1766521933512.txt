You are redesigning ONLY the “Why AI Engineering Now” section on the AI Engineering landing page (4geeks.com).
Context and intent
This is the first major explanatory section users see after entering the page.
Its purpose is to visually and conceptually explain why AI Engineering is becoming the core discipline of modern technology.
This section must feel strategic, forward-looking, and visually engaging, not generic.
Do NOT redesign the entire page. Only touch this section.
Overall layout (must keep this structure)
- Left column: key market metrics (already present).
- Right column: explanatory text + an interactive visual diagram.
- Two-column layout must remain balanced and breathable.
Left column (metrics)
- Keep the existing metrics content.
- Refine typography hierarchy:
  - Large numbers feel bold and confident.
  - Supporting text smaller and quieter.
- Add subtle entrance animation on scroll (fade + slight translate).
- Do NOT turn metrics into cards.
- Do NOT add borders or boxes.
They should feel editorial, not UI-heavy.
Right column (main redesign focus)
1) Replace the current generic illustration with an interactive conceptual diagram.
Diagram concept
- The diagram should visually represent AI Engineering as the central connective layer between:
  - models
  - data
  - infrastructure
  - applications
- AI Engineering is the orchestrator, not just “AI models”.
Visual structure
- Center node: “AI Engineering” (icon or symbol, not heavy text).
- Surrounding nodes:
  - Models (LLMs, training, inference)
  - Data (pipelines, vector stores, databases)
  - Infrastructure (cloud, deployment, scaling)
  - Applications (products, automation, agents)
- Nodes connected by subtle animated lines or dots.
Interaction behavior
- On hover or focus:
  - Highlight the hovered node.
  - Slightly dim the others.
  - Update a short descriptive caption below or beside the diagram explaining that layer’s role.
- Idle state:
  - Very subtle ambient motion (slow pulsing dots or gentle line animation).
  - No aggressive motion.
Design constraints (very important)
- Use ONLY the existing blue palette from the page.
- No new colors.
- No gradients that introduce new hues.
- Background remains clean and light (no dark sections here).
- Lines, dots, and highlights should be soft and minimal.
- Avoid heavy icons or illustrations.
Typography and copy
- Keep the heading “Why AI Engineering Now”.
- Keep the supporting text, but tighten it if needed to feel more strategic and less generic.
- Diagram labels should be short, single words or very short phrases.
- No paragraphs inside the diagram.
Animation guidelines
- All motion must feel slow, intentional, and elegant.
- No bouncing.
- No spinning.
- No fast transitions.
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion:
  - Show a static version of the diagram with no animation.
What NOT to do
- Do NOT use stock illustrations.
- Do NOT use cartoon-style graphics.
- Do NOT introduce cards or boxed UI here.
- Do NOT overload with text.
- Do NOT make it feel like a marketing infographic.
Acceptance criteria
- The section immediately communicates why AI Engineering matters now.
- The diagram feels modern, interactive, and intelligent.
- The visual matches the premium SaaS aesthetic of the rest of the page.
- The section no longer feels generic or templated.
- User attention is guided naturally from metrics → explanation → visual insight.
Implement the diagram using HTML/CSS/SVG/JS as needed, following existing project conventions.
